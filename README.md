# SpotifyUIThingy
Spotify UI written in java

This is still very WIP. Its currently 12:30 AM, so I need to post this and get to bed. This library uses this library: https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java

Should have used maven but Its too late for me to set that up properly

I still need to do a lot of code documentation.
